         Welcome to my portfolio website, thanks for stopping by! If you can't tell by the domain, headers and 
    footer... My name is AsiaMonet Mitchell. After reading this short biography and gaining some insight 
    into who I am, I invite you to peruse the rest of the site at your leisure and drop me an e-mail if you
    are interested in getting in touch. 

        Hmmm... Where do I start? ... I guess a great big rewind would be a good start. Because my favorite past-time
        is eating, I have decided to take that approach when explaining how I arrived here ... Bare with me.



 2005- TAPAS


 I got my first "taste" of "structured" technology at the age of 10 when the community center I attended
required the students in the program to partake in computer classes that focused on typing proficiency,
understanding source code and a variety of other seemingly uninteresting things (at the time). I was
fast at typing and opening up a browser and clicking through source code was amusing if anything, but at age
10... I didn't truly see the relevance or how investing my time into technology and Mavis Beacon made any sense, 
but I held strong and got the most from it that I could. Besides, showing my friends that you could get to 
Google Images just by adding "/imghp" was like a party trick that earned me cool points and allowed me to say
one of my favorite phrases of all time, "Bet you didn't know that". Outside of playing basketball with the boys
in the gymnasium during our free-time, the other place I frequented was the lab.

2012- Plato Principal (Main Dish)

 Fast-forward to my senior year of highschool, being the great student that I was *pats self on back*,
I was fortunate enough to dedicate the remainder of my education to things I found to be of interest. Enter
web-design. I spent a school-year creating websites, becoming acquainted with the front-end of web-devlopment,
and deciding that I really loved being in the lab. When it was time to figure out a path for college, unfortunately,
I was never pushed towards a technical route and was told to focus more on things that were "people-oriented",
so I did just that. Technology was more of a "boy" thing, people would always joke, I guess it manifested
itself as truth to me.

    2019- POSTRES

Postres means "dessert" in Spanish, and like the ending to any good bio-- this one is sweet. In my 
endeavors to improve the mentality of the generation behind me, I asked myself what small step I could take
to put myself in a position of positive change for others. The answer seemed simple enough, be an example. 
Growing up there were not a lot of "me's" to look up to and strive to be like. My "role-models" consisted of
athletes and entertainers. The few people in technology that I did know of, were males. Of course, I am not 
an unicorn, and with sufficient education and a bit of digging you can compile a HUGE list of female engineers
and software developers-- However, there is still a lot of work to do. 
<a href= "https://www.cnet.com/news/young-women-dominate-in-software-but-still-face-setbacks-says-hackerrank/"
 target= "_blank">Women in Tech!</a> It is easy enough to say this field is inclusive to woman, but why dig 
 when the example should be abundantly available. This isn't just a boy thing, this is a YOU thing and
the best way to solve a problem is to be a part of the solution...
